# Indigo Extensions

The Indigo Extensions library is a set of non-core abstractions and constructs to make game building easier.

You do not need the extensions library to use Indigo, but you're have to build everything yourself from the primitives indigo provides.

For example, Indigo does not have a scene manager because it does not care how you organise your game, but normally a scene manager would be a pretty useful thing to have. You can build it yourself of course, or you can use the one provided.

Indigo extensions also provide a number of simplified ways to initialise your game in the `entry` package.
