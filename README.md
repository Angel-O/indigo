# Indigo

Indigo is a non-traditional, proof of concept game engine written in Scala. It aims to allow programmers to build games using a purely functional set of APIs, focusing on developer productivity and testing.

Currently Indigo only exports web games, we hope to support more platforms in the future.

Documentation can be found on [indigoengine.io](https://indigoengine.io).

## Local build instructions

Assuming a machine with SBT and Mill installed, on Mac / Linux from the repo root:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

Stand well back.

>Windows users: Most of the things in the script mentioned above should work, but Indigo is not routinely built on Windows machines so we currently offer no guarantees or support. We hope to in the future.
