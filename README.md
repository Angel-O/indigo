# Indigo

Indigo is a non-traditional, proof of concept game engine written in Scala. It aims to allow programmers to build games using a purely functional set of APIs. 

> "I always wanted to be a 90's games programmer, valiantly hacking away in a spare room producing wonderous gaming experiences and worlds for people to get lost in ...although I've had to update the dream with a MacBook Pro and Scala."

Currently Indigo only exports web games, we hope to support more platforms in the future.

## Local build instructions

Assuming a machine with the JDK (1.8), SBT, and Mill installed...

On Mac / Linux from the project root:

```bash
bash ci.sh
```

Stand well back.

Windows users: Most of the things in the script above should work, but Indigo is not routinely built on Windows machines so we currently offer no guarantees or support.
