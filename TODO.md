# Building a 2D pixel art game engine
This kind of engine has some interesting properties.
There are no shaders to speak of.
There is no rotation.
Everything snaps to a pixel so all positions are absolute.
There might be physics, but then again, that could be built on top if it's needed at all.

The aim is to create layers starting with mutable ugly WebGL and leading up to Purely functional code.

The layers:
1. The Renderer
2. The Game Engine.
3. The game.

## TODO

Batch Renders
*************

The batching is complicated. The objects must be sorted

1. Move the vertex(and texture?) buffer array creation out of the renderer and make it upload for every object. --done
2. Apply matrices to vertex array before giving to renderer and simplify renderer matrix work. --done
3. Apply matrices to texture coords before giving to renderer and simplify renderer matrix work. --done
4. Move from triangle strips (unless you can figure out how to do several) to triangles. --done
5. Supply tint and alpha effect via vertex buffer --done
6. Turn a list of display objects with vertex buffers into a single vertex buffer and pass over for rendering.

Need for Speed
**************

Static collections of objects (Won't help perf test results, wrong kind of geometry)
- A static collection might need to be declared up front
- The collection is preprocessed heavily to result in maximum performance.
- Essentially this is either:
  a) A group of polys all at the same depth flattened into one rectangle with a preprocessed texture OR
  b) A collection of triangles all using the same texture atlas, uploaded to their own buffer for quick rendering.
     This option has the advantage of not needed all items to be on the same depth.
- These would be referenced in the view using a new type.

Prefabs (Won't help perf tests and we can almost do this already - and do using Aseprite objects)
- May not be needed if the work above is good enough... also needs more thought. Don't want to programmer to be worrying
  about things like object pools.
- Indigo will allow you to declare prefabs.
- These are identical to normal objects but in the view you just point at the prefab.
- Prefabs are prototypes, each prefab is copied in and is allowed minor adjustments before rendering.

Bugs:
- Lights don't work on a black background... should they?
- Should rendering text/font white space cost a draw call?

TODO
- Static objects (see below)
- Asset tags so that related image assets are grouped on the same atlas where possible

Indigo SBT Plugin
- Build one. The aim should be to speed up development and make testing simpler.

Renderer
- Layer effects (Hue, saturation, tint, Blur, Bloom.. anything else? )
- Pixel effects e.g. animate flood fill disolve

Game Engine
- Consider merging public and internal scenegraph classes and presenting a good old fashioned interface instead.
- Simpler ViewEvents. Need a way to add onClick to `this`.
- Config setting for hide mouse cursor
- Sound
- Full window size
- Full screen
- Tilemap loading
- Find a way to reduce requestAnimationFrame calls

Game
- Make game.

Optimisations:
- I think Scalajs is downloading script files on load, can they be local?
- Performance enhancement: Render at actual size to a buffer and scale up.
- Performance enhancement: We do some CPU side sorting, which generally will be ok, but if there are thousands of tiles
  and most of them never change, it would be nice to declare that somehow and only have to sort them once.
- Performance enhancement: Static objects. If you have a large group of rectangles that make up one big object - like
  level platforms - and they never move in relation to each other, we should be able to flatten them into one special
  object that can be drawn with a single call.
